# Dots

<ul>
  <li>See "connect-dots.gif" for preview</li>
  <li>Random amount of dots should be spawned each 0.5s at a random position on the stage</li>
  <li>Each dot MUST have a random life (amount of seconds after which it should disappear from the stage);</li>
  <li>Each dot MUST have random color and random radius;</li>
  <li>The dots MUST constantly move around within the stage bounds;</li>
  <li>If the distance between two dots gets below 100px, a line should be drawn between them;</li>
  <li>After a dot's life ends and the dot is removed from the stage, if it had been connected to another dot, the connection must break (line removed);</li>
  <li>(BONUS) When the dots needs to be removed from the stage (life ended), it should fade out</li>
  <li>(BONUS) Color of the line should be the sum of the colors of the connected dots(red + yellow = orange) OR a gradient may be applied.</li>
</ul>
